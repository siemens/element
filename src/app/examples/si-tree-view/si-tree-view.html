<!--
The tree doesn't have a default height, so you have to specify the `height` yourself. Otherwise, it will not be visible.
When using `class="h-100"` as in the example below, the parent container must also have a (fixed) height.
For production code, we recommend using flex-box in your whole application.

<si-tree-view
  ariaLabel="Company locations"
  class="h-100"
  [enableDataField1]="true"
  [enableSelection]="true"
  [items]="treeItems"
  [contextMenuItems]="menuItems"
/>
