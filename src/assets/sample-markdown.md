This is a separate paragraph that demonstrates how double line breaks create proper paragraph spacing.

## Code Examples

You can use inline code like `console.log('Hello World')` or multi-line code blocks:

```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = calculateSum(5, 3);
console.log(`Result: ${result}`);
```
