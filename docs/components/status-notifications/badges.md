# Badges

Badges act as visual aids notifying about a status of an object.
They carry different type of content such as a label or a counter to reflect a status.
Badges normally contain dynamic information.

## Usage ---

### Pill badge

Badges can display text or numbers, and may also include an icon. Choose between two visual styles: Default or Emphasis.

![Pill badge](images/pill-badge.png)

- Pill badges with text are usually integrated inside the data-tables and depicts each row's recent status.
- Used in conjunction with a single item or row to avoid ambiguity about which item is indicated.
- Pill badges can extend the width to fit desired text or numbers.
- Pill badges can also be used to indicate new or unread items with numbers.
- In case of a counter, the maximum count should be limited to 2 digits plus 1 character. For example `99+`.
- Status based categories are Default, Secondary, Inverse, Information, Success, Caution, Warning, Danger and Critical.

#### Best practices

- Consider the specified alignments while using Pill badges within the data-tables.
- Use status based categories to notify about a particular type of notification.
- Do not display status description in a badge.
- While showing a count, use integer numbers.
- If required, use tooltips for numbered badges to enhance user understanding.
- Place badges appropriately to identify the object they are informing or labelling.
- It is not recommended to use icons which are conflicting with semantic status color.

### Red dot tag with count

![Red dot tag with count](images/red-dot-with-count.png)

- These are global badges conveying a count and not a status.
- Use these to provide a visual cue of an object by notifying the recent changes.
- Maximum character count should be limited to 3 characters, i.e `99+`.

#### Best practices

- Use only natural numbers.
- Adjust the width to accommodate multiple digit numbers.
- Do not include text characters inside the badge.

### Red dot tag

- The red dot symbolizes a global notification update.
- If there is no content inside badge it can be represented with a simple dot.

#### Best practices

- Do not completely overlap the icon.
- Must be properly aligned to the upper right of the bounding box of the icon.
- Do not position badge out of the parent bounding box.

### Color variations - table

| Badges    | Status        | Fill Color                  | Text Style | Text Color                  |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| Default   | Default       | `$element-base-0`           | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-primary`     |
| Secondary | Secondary     | `$element-ui-3`             | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-primary`     |
| Inverse   | Inverse       | `$element-ui-1`             | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-inverse`     |
| Blue      | Informational | `$element-base-information` | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-information` |
| Green     | Success       | `$element-base-success`     | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-success`     |
| Yellow    | Caution       | `$element-base-caution`     | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-caution`     |
| Orange    | Warning       | `$element-base-warning`     | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-warning`     |
| Red       | Danger        | `$element-base-danger`      | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-danger`      |
| Magenta   | Critical      | `$element-base-critical`    | `Title 2`  | `$element-text-critical`    |

## Code ---

> **Note:** Badges can confuse users of screen readers and other assistive technologies because these users only hear the badge's
> content, not its visual styling. To a screen reader, a badge may sound like a random word or number tacked onto the end of a
> sentence, link, or button, which obscures its intended purpose.
>
> Unless the context is clear - you should add extra, descriptive text that is visually hidden but available to screen readers.

### Buttons

Badges can be used inside buttons to provide a counter:

```html
<!-- Badge inside a button which is hidden for assistive technologies -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
  Notifications <span class="badge text-bg-secondary" aria-hidden="true">4</span>
</button>
```

### Positioned

Use utility classes to modify the `.badge` and easily position it within the corner of a parent element like a link or button.

> **Note:** Ensure the parent container provide enough spacing to visualize the absolute positioned badge.

```html
<!-- Badge inside a button with descriptive text that is visually hidden -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary position-relative">
  Inbox
  <span class="position-absolute top-0 start-100 translate-middle badge rounded-pill bg-danger">
    99+
    <span class="visually-hidden">unread messages</span>
  </span>
</button>
```

### Background colors

Applying a background-color is done via `.bg-{status tokens}`. Here the complete list of color classes:

- `.bg-default`
- `.bg-primary`
- `.bg-secondary`
- `.bg-info`
- `.bg-success`
- `.bg-caution`
- `.bg-warning`
- `.bg-danger`
- `.bg-critical`
- `.bg-inverse`
- `.bg-info-emphasis`
- `.bg-success-emphasis`
- `.bg-warning-emphasis`
- `.bg-danger-emphasis`
- `.bg-critical-emphasis`
- `.bg-caution-emphasis`

### Icons

The `badge-dot` class provides a smaller dot that can be placed at the side of an icon:

```html
<i role="status" aria-label="notifications" class="icon element-alarm-filled badge-dot"></i>
```

The `badge-text` class provides the ability to apply a short text at the side of an icon:

```html
<div role="status" aria-label="More than 99 notifications">
  <i class="icon element-alarm-filled"></i>
  <span class="badge-text" aria-hidden="true">99+</span>
</div>
```
