## Time based vocabulary: Last, latest and recent

- Last implies nothing else will follow. It's the last, and after this it is finished. No more are coming.
- Latest implies that it is the last to date, which means there could be more to follow. Most recent. Newest.
- Recent is more time focused and is similar to latest. It means that it happened a short time ago.
- Avoid the adjectives last, latest and recent if the verb relates to a time stamp (e.g., column header).
