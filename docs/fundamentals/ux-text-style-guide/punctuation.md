Always consider whether necessary

### Exclamation mark `!`

- Exclamation mark for high-level warnings only, and if the severity is not already expressed by other design elements like icons or color

### Question mark `?`

- Avoid question marks in modal titles

### Colon `:`

- Use colons: especially to introduce lists
- Avoid and remove colons whenever possible, for example `User name` instead of `User name:`
- Avoid and remove colons in headings

### Full stops `.`

- Full stops at the end of all full sentences
- Full stops before all lower-case file extensions: .csv .txt .zip
- Avoid full stops before upper-case file extensions: CSV TXT ZIP
- Consistent use of full stops throughout the application

### Ellipsis `…`

- Ellipsis only for transitional text: `Uploading…`

### Single quotation mark `'`

### Asterisks `*`

- Avoid asterisks

### Brackets `() []`

- Avoid brackets `( )` and `[ ]`
- No brackets for plurals, for example `{{cnt}} users added` instead of `{{cnt}} user(s) added`
