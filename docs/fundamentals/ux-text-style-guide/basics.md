# Basics

The following sections contain advice we follow at Siemens to create our own products and includes common
writing errors to avoid when creating industrial products and experiences.

## Style

- Use as few words as possible
- Use simple, specific, clear, and informative wording
- Use the same words and grammatical forms, lengths, and styles repeatedly

## Tone and voice

- Use natural, conversational language and not robotic, funny, cool or clever
- Avoid to talk to the user directly on the UI
- Talk to users directly in formal contexts only (e.g., email bodies, app tour, …)
- Address users in second-person (you) and use first-person plural for the application (we) if direct communication is used
- Use gender-neutral language
- Use polite language
- Avoid 'please', 'sorry' and other forms of apology
- Use positive instead of negative framing
- Avoid using contractions in general

## Length

- Use sentences only when necessary
- Use short words (3, 4, or 5 letters) instead of long words (8 or longer)
- Use short, scannable segments, not paragraphs
- Keep sentences under 25 words (average = 15 words)
- Keep titles under 65 characters (including spaces)
- Use info icons only when necessary: Icons cannot contain the same content as the UI

## Capitalization

- Capitalize the first letter of the first word in a title / sentence / tooltip / menu item / list item / button
- Do not use all-caps (e.g., `PLANNING` → `Planning`)
- Capitalize proper nouns, i.e. places, organizations, tools, languages, products and things according the [proper nouns](proper-nouns.md) chapter
- Capitalize named app functions and UI elements: Go to Settings, Allocate users in User management, Press OK
