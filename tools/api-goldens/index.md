# API Goldens

This directory contains the script needed to generate and verify API goldens for the Element library.
This script is using [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) internally.
Since the API Extractor is currently not supporting multiple entrypoints, it is called separately for each entrypoint.

See the [Developer Guide](../../DEVELOPER.md) for usage instructions.
